# Work-Scheduler

Description: 

This is an assigment in which I made a simple work scheduler. It displays the current date at the top and twelve rows to write and save appointments, reminders, or notes. Any text entered can be saved using the icons on the right. Each space will change color depending on the time. If the hour(s) has passed, the space is grey. The current hour will be red, and the future hour(s) will be green.

Usage:

To utilize my assignment, you may use it from my github repository.
